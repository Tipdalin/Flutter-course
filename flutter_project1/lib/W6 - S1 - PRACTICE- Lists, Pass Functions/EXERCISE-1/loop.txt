Q1: In what scenarios might one approach be more advantageous than another?

Integrating the loop directly in the list:

-Advantages: Good for quick, simple lists with minimal logic.
-Disadvantages: Readability and maintainability decline when the logic becomes complex or requires debugging.

Using the map() method:

-Advantages: Elegant and concise, especially for transforming existing lists.
-Disadvantages: Slightly harder to debug if the transformation logic becomes too complex.

Using a dedicated function:

-Advantages: Best for complex or reusable logic. Enhances readability and maintainability.
-Disadvantages: Slightly more verbose for simple tasks.
