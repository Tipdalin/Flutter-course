This task can also be done with the help of ListView then why we used ListView.builder?

The answer to this question is that we can do the same task with the help of ListView 
but when we have numerous items(for ex: 10000) then it is inefficient to create these items
with ListView because it loads all the list items at once but ListView.
builder make this task quicker by creating layouts for  items visible
on the screen with the help of itemBuilder & lazily build other layouts/containers as the user scrolls.
