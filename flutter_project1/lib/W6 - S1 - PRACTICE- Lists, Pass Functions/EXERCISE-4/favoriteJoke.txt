1. What type of data will store the jokes?
Type: A list of maps (List<Map<String, String>>).
Each joke is represented as a Map with fields for id, title, and description. 
This structure makes it easy to access joke information by key.
2. What type of data will store the favorite joke?
Type: A String? (nullable string) representing the id of the favorite joke.
Explanation: Storing just the id of the favorite joke allows us to efficiently track which joke is marked as favorite.
If no joke is selected, this value is null.
3. Which widget should be in charge of storing the favorite joke?
Widget: The FavoriteJokesList widget.
Explanation: The FavoriteJokesList widget is responsible for managing and updating the state of the favorite joke. 
It holds the _favoriteJokeId variable to track the current favorite.
4. Which widget should be stateful?
Widget: FavoriteJokesList.
Explanation: FavoriteJokesList is stateful because it needs to remember and update which joke is currently marked as the favorite.
5. How will your widget interact?
Interaction: FavoriteJokesList passes each jokeâ€™s data, along with the favorite status and a callback function, to each FavoriteCard widget.
Explanation: FavoriteJokesList iterates through the list of jokes and passes a callback (onFavoriteSelected) to each FavoriteCard so that each card can request to set itself as the favorite.
6. Do you need to pass a callback function between widgets?
Yes.
Explanation: The FavoriteJokesList widget passes a callback function (onFavoriteSelected) to each FavoriteCard. 
This callback allows FavoriteCard to notify FavoriteJokesList when a joke is selected as the favorite, so it can update the _favoriteJokeId accordingly.
